Multi-Agent Meeting Scheduler



#Setting.java

#Number of users in the Meeting Scheduler Agent Based System.

We have five(5) users with their respective usernames and password in our meeting scheduler system. Initially, the Username and password are fixed within the system boundary as given in the setting.java file But We can add more users to our system with the help of the setting.java file too. As we have no database in our system to store the credential, we explicitly gave that in the setting.java file.
